Instructions for usage of VTJS-library
- Library is in very early stage, 
  therefore currently you can only apply one case per function

Setup:
- Download jquery and call it in html
- Download vtjs.js-file or create a new one and copy the source code to the file
- Call the library in html-file (after main jquery-file)
- Enjoy! (or not)

Usage:
- Create your jquery/javascript-file and call it in your html
- Define functions in the file
- Example: var open_activator = "#youractivatorobject"; (var sort of creates 
  the function, text before underscore specifies which function you are 
  taking advantage of, class can be used as well)
- To make a function work, 
  you always need to define 
  every variable that specific function uses
- All functions and variables listed below

Functions and their variables:
- Open object (opens specified object)
	- var open_activator = '#youractivatorobject'; // Object that activates the function
	- var open_id = '#yourtargetobject'; // Object that you want to open
	- var open_method = 'fade'; // 'fade' will fade the object in, 'appear' will just appear the object
	- var open_animdur = '300'; // Specifies the duration of fade
